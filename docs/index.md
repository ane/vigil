**Vigil** is a [Clojure](http://clojure.org) library for turning files into [asynchronous streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing).

If you want to monitor log files as raw data, Vigil is the tool for that. If you want to
create a file-based event filtering system, Vigil can be used as the underlying data source.
