# ![Vigil](./doc/vigil.png) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ane/vigil.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ane/vigil) [![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/vigil.svg)](https://clojars.org/vigil) [![EPL](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/abf24e4845a7f0721ff08b2a8284ded5d9cfdefa/687474703a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f6c6963656e73652d45504c2d626c75652e7376673f7374796c653d666c6174)](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) 
**Vigil** creates [Manifold](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold) streams from files.  You place a
*watcher* on a file and the stream produces content as new content is appended to the file.
```clojure
[vigil "0.1.1"] ; add this to your project.clj
```
Vigil can be used to monitor logs asynchronously as a stream. If you are creating an event-driven
system, it's easy to create an event filter with Vigil.

Because the produced streams are Manifold streams, which act as a general-purpose compability
layers for asynchronous communication, the file streams can be easily
[connected](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold/blob/master/docs/stream.md) into other 
Clojure constructs, such as [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async), lazy sequences,
promises, the list goes on. 

For more information, see the [documentation](https://ane.github.io/vigil/).

``` clojure
(require '[vigil.core :as v]
         '[manifold.stream :as s])

;; /foo/bar/baz contains "hello\nworld"
(def stream (v/watch-file "/foo/bar/baz"))

@(s/take! stream)
;; => ("hello" "world")

(spit "/foo/bar/baz" "blah\n" :append true)

;; the new line has now been pushed to the stream
@(s/take! stream)
;; => ("blah")

;; shut down the watcher
(s/close! stream)

```

## Usage

The watcher can be stopped at any time by closing the stream. If you don't want to receive the
initial content, pass `false` to the `initial` parameter in `watch-file`. If you delete or truncate
the file, the watcher will stop and the stream will be closed.
