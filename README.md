[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ane/vigil.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ane/vigil)

`[vigil "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]`

**Vigil** creates [Manifold](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold) streams from files.  You place a
*watcher* on a file and the stream produces content as new content is appended to the file.

Vigil can be used to monitor logs asynchronously as a stream. If you are creating an event-driven
system, it's easy to create an event filter with Vigil.

Because the produced streams are Manifold streams, which act as a general-purpose compability
layers for asynchronous communication, the file streams can be easily
[connected](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold/blob/master/docs/stream.md) into other 
Clojure constructs, such as [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async), lazy sequences,
promises, the list goes on. See the [example](#example).

``` clojure
(require '[vigil.core :as v])

;; /foo/bar/baz contains "hello\nworld"
(def stream (v/watch-file "/foo/bar/baz"))

@(s/take! stream)
;; => ("hello" "world")

(spit "/foo/bar/baz" "blah\n" :append true)

;; the new line has now been pushed to the stream
@(s/take! stream)
;; => ("blah")

;; shut down the watcher
(s/close! stream)

```


## Usage

The watcher can be stopped at any time by closing the stream. If you don't want to receive the
initial content, pass `false` to the `initial` parameter in `watch-file`.

### Example

``` clojure
(require '[manifold.stream :as s]
         '[vigil.core :as v]
         '[core.async :as a])
         
(def fs (v/watch-file "/foo/bar/baz"))

(let [ch (s/connect fs (a/chan))]
  (go-loop
    (when-let [stuff (a/<! ch)]
       (println stuff)
       (recur))))
       
(Thread/sleep 60000)

;; append content into /foo/bar/baz
;; ... and it shall be printed

(s/close! fs)

```

#### Deletion or truncation

If you delete the file, the watcher will stop. Truncating the file will make the watcher reset its
*cursor* to the beginning. Truncation occurs when the cursor location has been observed to be
greater than the length of the file.
